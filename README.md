# Predicting Competitive Bid Amounts for Federal Health IT Contracts

## Overview
This project explores how data analytics can support capture managers in the Civilian Federal Health IT space by predicting the bid amount most likely to win a federal contract. Inspired by real procurement workflows at companies like DLH Corp, this case study applies regression modeling to past award data to guide price-to-win (PTW) strategies.

## Business Context

> *"How can we use historical federal procurement data to inform smarter, more competitive bids in high-stakes Health IT contracting?"*

Capture managers often operate under intense time pressure, with limited visibility into competitorsâ€™ pricing or government budgets. By leveraging award history from public datasets, we estimate optimal bid ranges and win likelihoods â€” enabling better bid/no-bid decisions and more strategic proposals.

---

## Project Objectives
- Estimate winning bid amounts for federal Health IT contracts using historical data
- Identify key drivers of award amounts across agencies, NAICS codes, and contract types
- Create interpretable outputs for price-to-win and capture planning
- Build a foundation for analytics-enabled bid strategy

---

## Data Sources
- [USAspending.gov](https://www.usaspending.gov/) â€” Contract award data from HHS, CMS, NIH, and VA  
- FPDS or SAM.gov (optional): Enrichment from solicitations or contract details  
- Fields used: Award Amount, Number of Bidders, Set-Aside Type, NAICS, PSC, Agency, Award Type, Place of Performance, and more

---

## Data Preparation
- Filtered dataset for awarded Health IT-related contracts from 2018â€“2024
- Cleaned inconsistent award formats and agency naming conventions
- Engineered features: average bids per NAICS, contract competitiveness score, seasonality, and more

---

## Modeling Approach
- Regression models: XGBoost, Random Forest, Lasso
- Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, cross-validation
- Model interpretation: SHAP feature importance, residual analysis

---

## Key Insights
- The top predictors of award amounts included agency, contract type, NAICS code, and number of bids received
- Health IT bids varied significantly by agency, with CMS and NIH showing tighter pricing thresholds
- Competitive awards (5+ bidders) tended to fall within a narrower bid range than sole source or set-asides

---

## Strategic Takeaways for Capture Managers
- **Price-to-Win Estimation Tool**: Outputs bid amount ranges likely to win under different scenarios
- **Bid/No-Bid Decision Support**: Predictive likelihood of success by opportunity type
- **Agency-Specific Strategy**: Tailor pricing strategy by department (e.g., HHS vs. VA)
